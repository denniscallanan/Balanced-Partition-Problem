# Balanced-Partition-Problem

I wrote this program in Cpp and ran it on several multi-core machines in an attempt to find the lowest solution to the Balanced Partition Problem given here:

I added an element of randomness combined with some complexity and a method for precomputing values in order to skip a huge percentage of permutations. Pre computing values is the core algorithm behind the efficiency of my program. 

Simply compile the code and run. Only executable on 64-bit Windows Platform.
